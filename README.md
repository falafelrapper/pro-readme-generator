# Fullstack Development Challenge 7

## Welcome to the seventh Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to rework a starter code so that we could have a professional README generator! To do this, we are using node.js to start an index.js file and have it make us a professional README.md file that we can use for our projects! To start, lets look at our requirements:

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a working index.js file that will allow you to answer a series of questions now. From there, after completing these questions, you should be presented with a new README.md file in your final-readme folder after you have downloaded this file.
